# Is natural language logical? 

[Alfred Tarski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Tarski), a renowned logician, believed that his definition of truth only applied to formalized languages, not natural languages. He thought that the meaning of truth in natural languages was vague and could only be approximated. 

First of all, let's see how natural language differ from formal language, particularly formal logic. 

Logical operators (e.g., $\wedge$ for "and," $\vee$ for "or") are often assumed to differ from their natural language counterparts.

Some view natural language as vague and imprecise, regarding logical language as a more refined and structured alternative. Others argue that natural language, while distinct from formal logic, is richer and not inherently inferior, advocating for the study of "natural logic" as a discipline separate from formal logic.

## From Chomsky to Grice

In the early 1960s, [Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) demonstrated that natural language syntax could be systematically analyzed using rules and constraints. However, he did not believe that meaning could be studied through the same approach.

Inspired by Chomsky, [Montague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Montague) advocated for a formal approach to truth-conditional meaning, proposing that natural language meaning is compositional and can be systematically derived from word meanings and combinatorial rules.  

In the late 1960s, [Grice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Grice) had the inspired idea to 'formalize' pragmatics in the same way.  

- The meanings of standard logical operators closely resemble those of their natural language counterparts.
- The widespread belief to the contrary stems from a failure to differentiate between semantics and pragmatics
  - the literal semantic content of a sentence ("what is literally said");
  - the various pragmatic inferences that can be drawn from the speaker's use of that sentence in a given context.
