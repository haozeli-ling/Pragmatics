# Social meaning 

Since [Labov (1963)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799), sociolinguistics has studied the subtle meaning differences between linguistic variants. 

1. I am walking (velar '-ing' variant).
2. I am wakin  (apical '-in' variant)

Sentence 1 and 2 have the same literal meanings, but after hearing them, listeners tend to infer different properties of the speaker:

- Sentence 1 is associated with education, intelligence, articulateness (clustered as **competent**),  and formality and distance (clustered **aloof**).
- Sentence 2 is associated with the opposite properties. 

This difference is assumed to be part of social meanings. People’s production of language is sensitive to such social meanings and the context. Labov (2012) analyzes President Obama’s use of (ING) across three recordings, each captured in a context with a different level of formality.

- Barbecue: 72% -in’ (casual)
- Press conference that follows: 33% -in’ (careful)
- Democratic National Committee acceptance speech: 3% (formal)
