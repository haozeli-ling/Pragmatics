# Social meaning 

Since [Labov (1963)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799), sociolinguistics has studied the subtle meaning differences between linguistic variants. 

1. I am walking (velar '-ing' variant).
2. I am wakin  (apical '-in' variant)

Sentence 1 and 2 have the same literal meanings, but after hearing them, listeners tend to infer different properties of the speaker:

- Sentence 1 is associated with education, intelligence, articulateness (clustered as **competent**),  and formality and distance (clustered **aloof**).
- Sentence 2 is associated with the opposite properties.
