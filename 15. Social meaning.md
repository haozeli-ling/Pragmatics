# Social meaning 

Since [Labov (1963)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799), sociolinguistics has studied the subtle meaning differences between linguistic variants. 

1. I am walking (velar '-ing' variant).
2. I am wakin  (apical '-in' variant)

Sentence 1 and 2 have the same literal meanings, but after hearing them, listeners tend to infer different properties of the speaker:

- Sentence 1 is associated with education, intelligence, articulateness (clustered as **competent**),  and formality and distance (clustered **aloof**).
- Sentence 2 is associated with the opposite properties. 

This difference is assumed to be part of social meanings. People’s production of language is sensitive to such social meanings and the context. Labov (2012) analyzes President Obama’s use of (ING) across three recordings, each captured in a context with a different level of formality.

- Barbecue: 72% -in’ (casual)
- Press conference that follows: 33% -in’ (careful)
- Democratic National Committee acceptance speech: 3% (formal)

It demonstrates that linguistic expressions convey not only truth-conditional contents, but also aspects of persona shaped by context. 

How can our pragmatic theory capture the social meanings that hinge on linguistic expressions?

### Multi-dimensional meanings

Natural language meaning is multi-dimensional. A sentence has a literal meaning but it may involve some lexical items that evoke additional, relatively independent meanings.  

3. That **damn** printer jammed again. <br>
   Truth-conditional: The printer jammed. <br>
   Expressive: "damn" shows frustration.

4. I **ain’t** going **nowhere**. (Code-switching or dialect features) <br>
   Truth-conditional: The speaker is not going anywhere. <br>
   Expressive: Signals identity, stance, or group affiliation.

### Reasoning over use-conditional meaning (Qing & Cohn-Gordon 2019)

Based on Potts (2007), the social meaning evoked by the usage of 'ing' or 'in' operates on a separate dimension from the literal content. Under the RSA model, the literal listener updates their prior belief about the situation $s$ based on literal meaning. Meanwhile, they update their prior belief about the speaker type $i$ by reasoning about a hypothetical stereotypical speaker. 

$L_0\ (s,i | u) = L_0\ (s | u) \cdot L_0\ (i | u)$
