# Social meaning 

Since [Labov (1963)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799), sociolinguistics has studied the subtle meaning differences between linguistic variants. 

1. I am walking (velar '-ing' variant).
2. I am wakin  (apical '-in' variant)

Sentence 1 and 2 have the same literal meanings, but after hearing them, listeners tend to infer different properties of the speaker:

- Sentence 1 is associated with education, intelligence, articulateness (clustered as **competent**),  and formality and distance (clustered **aloof**).
- Sentence 2 is associated with the opposite properties. 

This difference is assumed to be part of social meanings. People’s production of language is sensitive to such social meanings and the context. Labov (2012) analyzes President Obama’s use of (ING) across three recordings, each captured in a context with a different level of formality.

- Barbecue: 72% -in’ (casual)
- Press conference that follows: 33% -in’ (careful)
- Democratic National Committee acceptance speech: 3% (formal)

It demonstrates that linguistic expressions convey not only truth-conditional contents, but also aspects of persona shaped by context. 

How can our pragmatic theory capture the social meanings that hinge on linguistic expressions?

### Multi-dimensional meanings

Natural language meaning is multi-dimensional. A sentence has a literal meaning but it may involve some lexical items that evoke additional, relatively independent meanings.  

3. That **damn** printer jammed again. <br>
   Truth-conditional: The printer jammed. <br>
   Expressive: "damn" shows frustration.

4. I **ain’t** going **nowhere**. (Code-switching or dialect features) <br>
   Truth-conditional: The speaker is not going anywhere. <br>
   Expressive: Signals identity, stance, or group affiliation.

Therefore, the use of '-in' or '-ing' triggers a social meaning in addition to the literal meaning. 

5. I am walking. <br>
   Truth-conditional: the speaker is walking. <br>
   Social meaning: the speaker is competent or aloof.

6. I am walkin. <br>
   Truth-conditional: the speaker is walking. <br>
   Social meaning: the speaker is incompetent or friendly.

### Reasoning over use-conditional meaning (Qing & Cohn-Gordon 2019)

Based on Potts (2007), the social meaning evoked by the usage of 'ing' or 'in' operates on a separate dimension from the literal content. Under the RSA model, the literal listener updates their prior belief about the situation $s$ based on literal meaning. Meanwhile, they update their prior belief about the speaker type $i$ by reasoning about a hypothetical stereotypical speaker. 

$L_0\ (s,i | u) = L_0\ (s | u) \cdot L_0\ (i | u)$

- $L_0\ (s | u) = \displaystyle \frac{ ⟦u⟧(s) \cdot P(s)}{ \Sigma_{s' \in S}\ ⟦u⟧(s') \cdot P(s')}$

- $L_0\ (i | u) = \displaystyle \frac{ ST(u | i) \cdot P(i)}{ \Sigma_{i' \in I}\ ST(u | i') \cdot P(i')}$

Let's assume that there are four kinds of persona. 

- Stern Leader: competent and aloof
- Cool Guy: competent and friendly
- Asshole: incompetent and aloof
- Doofus: incompetent and friendly

Hypothetical prior belief: 

- P(Stern Leader) = 0.3
- P(Cool Guy) = 0.2
- P(Asshole) = 0.3
- P(Doofus) = 0.2

The social meanings related to 'ing' and 'in'

- 'ing': competent or aloof
- 'in': incompetent or friendly

**Stereotypical Speaker**

$ST(u | o)$: how likely a stereotypical speaker with persona $i$ would produce $u$

|       | Stern Leader: competent & aloof | Cool Guy: competent & friendly | Asshole: incompetent & aloof | Doofus: incompetent & friendly | 
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------| 
| 'ing'   |   0.7   |     0.3    |   0.1      |   0.01      |    
| 'in'   |   0.3  |     0.7   |   0.9   |   0.99   |       

$L_0\ (\text{Cool Guy} | \text{'in'}) = \displaystyle \frac{ ST(\text{'in'} | \text{Cool Guy}) \cdot P(\text{Cool Guy})}{ \Sigma_{i' \in I}\ ST(\text{'in'} | i') \cdot P(i')} = \frac{0.14}{0.668} \approx 0.2096$

$L_0\ (\text{Cool Guy} | \text{'ing'}) = \displaystyle \frac{ ST(\text{'ing'} | \text{Cool Guy}) \cdot P(\text{Cool Guy})}{ \Sigma_{i' \in I}\ ST(\text{'in'} | i') \cdot P(i')} = \frac{0.06}{0.302} \approx 0.199$

Calculation of the denominator: 

- $\Sigma_{i' \in I}\ ST('in' | i') \cdot P(i')$ <br>
  $= ST(\text{Cool Guy} | \text{'in'}) \cdot P(\text{Cool Guy}) + ST(\text{Stern Leader} | \text{'in'}) \cdot P(\text{Stern Leader}) + ST(\text{Asshole} | \text{'in'}) \cdot P(\text{Asshole}) + ST(\text{Doofus} | \text{'in'}) \cdot P(\text{Doofus})$ <br>
  $= 0.7 \cdot 0.2 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.9 \cdot 0.3 + 0.99 \cdot 0.2$ <br>
  $= 0.668$

- $\Sigma_{i' \in I}\ ST('ing' | i') \cdot P(i')$ <br>
  $= ST(\text{Cool Guy} | \text{'ing'}) \cdot P(\text{Cool Guy}) + ST(\text{Stern Leader} | \text{'ing'}) \cdot P(\text{Stern Leader}) + ST(\text{Asshole} | \text{'ing'}) \cdot P(\text{Asshole}) + ST(\text{Doofus} | \text{'ing'}) \cdot P(\text{Doofus})$ <br>
  $= 0.3 \cdot 0.2 + 0.7 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.01 \cdot 0.2$ <br>
  $= 0.302$

**Obama as a pragmatic speaker**

$P_{S_1} (u | i) = \displaystyle \frac{\exp(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,i))}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ \exp(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',i))}$   

- $\text{Utility}'(u,i) = \ln (L_{0, Q} (i | u)) - \text{Cost}'(u)$
- Assume that 'in' and 'ing' do not have any cost;
- Assume that $\alpha = 6$ (Obama is determinstic)

$P_{S_1} ('in' | \text{Gool Guy}) = \displaystyle \frac{\exp(6 \cdot \text{Utility}'('in', \text{Gool Guy}))}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ \exp(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u', \text{Gool Guy}))} = 0.5772$

$P_{S_1} ('ing' | \text{Gool Guy}) = \displaystyle \frac{\exp(6 \cdot \text{Utility}'('ing', \text{Gool Guy}))}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ \exp(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u', \text{Gool Guy}))} = 0.4228$


Calculation of the denominator: 

- $\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ \exp(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',\text{Gool Guy})) = exp(6 \cdot ln(0.2096)) + exp(6 \cdot ln(0.199)) \approx 0.0001469$

Since $P_{S_1} ('in' | \text{Gool Guy}) > P_{S_1} ('ing' | \text{Gool Guy})$, Obama would prefer '-in’' to '-ing' to construct the COOL GUY persona
