# Scalar implicature 

These are the most extensively studied types of implicatures to date, particularly the class that has garnered the greatest formal and experimental focus.

**Definition** An utterance *U* conveys a scalar implicature if and only if there exist alternative utterances *U*' that are at least as relevant as *U* in the discourse and are communicatively stronger than *U*.

## Data

1. John or Bill showed up.

   > In First Order Logic (FOL), the sentence is true if and only if John showed up, Bill showed up, or both showed up. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **John or Bill showed up, but NOT both**.

2. Peter did some of the homework.

   > In FOL, the sentence is true if and only if Peter did at least some of the homework. <br>
   > So, it can be true if Peter did all of the homework. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **Peter did some of homework, but NOT all**.

3. Sue bought three houses.

   > In FOL, the sentence is true if and only if Sue bought at least three houses. <br>
   > So, it can be true if Sue bought more than three houses. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **Sue bought three houses, but NOT more than three**.

4. You are allowed to leave.

   > In FOL, this sentence is true in the situation where the addressee must leave.
   > However, we typically interpret it as: **I can leave, but I am NOT requireed to leave**.

5. This movie is good.

   > In FOL, this sentence is true if the movie is the best movie of this year.
   > However, we typically interpret it as: **this movie is good, but NOT the best**.

All examples involve a lexical item that triggers scalar alternatives: 

- coordinations: (or, and)
- quantifiers: (some, many, most, every/all)
- numerals: (one, two, three, . . .)
- modals: (allowed to, required to)
- adjectives: (good, best)

## Two potential solutions regarding lexical semantics

**First attempt**: What if we assume that the relevant items inherently encode a stronger meaning? In other words, this implies that scalar implicature is embedded within their lexical meaning.

> For example 
>
> John or Bill showed up. 
> - This sentence is true if and only if John showed up or Bill showed up, but not both.
>
> Sue bought three houses.
> - This sentence is true if and only if Sue bought exactly three houses. 

Although this solution is fairly straightforward, it cannot be correct, as these lexical items sometimes exhibit weaker interpretations or adhere to standard FOL meanings in certain contexts.

First of all, scalar implicatures can be canceled, but lexical meanings cannot. 

6. Peter did some of the homework. For all I know he might have done all of it. <br>
   $\not\leadsto$ Peter did some of the homework but not all. For all I know he might have done all of it. 

Second, scalar implicatures are not attested in the so-called **downward-entailing contexts**. 

7. This movie is not good. <br>
   $\not\leadsto$ It is not the case that this movie is good, but NOT the best. <br>
   This sentence means that this movie is bad. 

8. If Sue bought three houses, I will be very angry with her. <br>
   $\not\leadsto$ If Sue bought exactly three houses, I will be very angry with her. <br>
   This sentence does not imply that I won't be angry if Sue bought four houses.

 
**Second attempt**: What if those lexical items are ambiguous between a strong and a weak meaning, with the two interpretations emerging in different contexts? Specifically, strong meanings are blocked in the downward-entailing contexts. 

However, this lexical ambiguity solution is empirically insufficient, because scalar implicatures are reversed in downward-entailing contexts.   

9. Peter did much of the homework.

   > This sentence implies that Peter did much of the homework, but NOT all.

10. Peter didn't do much of the homework.

    > This sentence implies that Peter did some of the homework, but NOT much.

## Pragmatic approach 

Scalar implicature is derived based on Gricean maxims. 

- Teacher: Peter did some of the homework.
 
> - The speaker is following the **Maxim of Quantity**.  Therefore, her statement was ‘as informative as possible without breaking the other maxims’.
> - If the speaker has instead utter one of the following sentences (scalar alternatives), she would have made a more informative statement.
>   - Peter did all of the homework.
>     - 'Peter did all of the homework' entails 'Peter did some of the homework', but not vice versa. 
>   - Peter did most of the homework.
>   - Peter did many of the homework.
> - Since the speaker didn’t utter 'Peter did all of the homework', it follows that such an utterance would have broken some other maxim (namely, Quality).
> - Therefore, it must be that the speaker believes that 'Peter did all of the homework' is false, or she doesn’t have enough evidence to assert it.
> - However, the speaker is assumed to know how much of homework Peter did.  Therefore, the speaker must know that 'Peter did all of the homework' is false.
> - Conclusion: Peter did some of the homework, but NOT all.  

**Note** The reasoning relies upon the following assumption: The speaker knows the truth value of 'Peter did all of the homework'. Therefore, if the assumption does not hold in context, then the scalar implicature in question won't arise. 

> Sue and Peter are classmates in the same afterschool program. That day, they both worked on their homework during the session. While Sue noticed Peter diligently working on his assignments, she couldn’t tell how far he got because she was picked up by her parent earlier than Peter. Later that evening, while recounting her day to her mom, Sue mentioned, <br>
> "Peter was working on his homework at the afterschool program. **He did some of it—I saw him—but I’m not sure if he finished**. Maybe he got through all of it after I left."

Exercise: Please derive the scalar implicatures for the following sentences.

a. John or Bill showed up.
b. Sue bought three houses.
```
```
Discussion: Explain why scalar implicatures do not arise in down-entailing contexts. 

```
Discussion: In natural language, a conditional sentence is usually understood as a bi-conditional statement in FOL. Explain this phenomenon using Gricean reasoning.

a. If you work hard, you will secure a good grade.
