# The exponential function in RSA

$P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

$\text{Utility}'$ is a measure of how effective an utterance $u$ is for communicating a state $s$, but **utility itself isnâ€™t a probability**. 

The exponential function $e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}$: 

- Ensures that higher utility values translate to higher probabilities.
- Provides a non-linear scaling, where small differences in utility are magnified, which is especially useful in capturing human-like decision-making.

This is particularly important in RSA, where the speaker chooses utterances probabilistically, rather than deterministically picking the highest-utility option.

### Soft-maximization

The RSA speaker does not always choose the single highest-utility utterance. Instead, the use of the exponential function allows for soft-maximization, where:

- Higher-utility utterances are more likely to be chosen, but lower-utility utterances are still possible.
- This probabilistic behavior aligns better with real-world human communication, where speakers sometimes use less-than-optimal utterances due to noise, cognitive constraints, or contextual factors.

### Ensures probabilities are positive 

Note that $\text{Utility}'$ 

Probabilities cannot be negative. The exponential function satisfies this requirement because for all $x$ $e^x > 0$.
