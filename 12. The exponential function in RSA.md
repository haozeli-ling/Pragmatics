# The exponential function in RSA

$P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

$\text{Utility}'$ is a measure of how effective an utterance $u$ is for communicating a state $s$, but **utility itself isnâ€™t a probability**. 

The exponential function $e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}$: 

- Ensures that higher utility values translate to higher probabilities.
- Provides a non-linear scaling, where small differences in utility are magnified, which is especially useful in capturing human-like decision-making.
