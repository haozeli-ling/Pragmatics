# The exponential function in RSA

$P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

$\text{Utility'}$ is a measure of how effective an utterance $u$ is for communicating a state $s$, but utility itself isnâ€™t a probability.
