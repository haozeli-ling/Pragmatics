# Layers of of pragmatic enrichment

Pragmatics explores how we expand the conventional meanings of spoken and written language into their richer, intended interpretations. In this course, we will examine the principles that drive this process of enrichment, paying particular attention to how systematic and universal these principles are.

## Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics

The term "pragmatics" was introduced by Charles Morris in 1938. As part of semiotics, the broader study of signs, Morris identified three distinct branches: 
- **Syntax**: Examines how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
  - Concerned with well-formedness and structural relationships.
- **Semantics**: Focuses on meaning, such as truth conditions, reference, and logical form.
  - Example: "All cats are mammals" is true if every individual cat is a mammal.
- **Pragmatics**: Explores how context influences meaning, including speaker intentions and assumptions.
  - Example: The phrase "Can you open the window?" pragmatically implies a request rather than a question about ability.

Recent research has increasingly questioned the rigid separation between semantics and pragmatics suggested by the traditional trichotomy. The field of formal pragmatics specifically addresses areas where semantics and pragmatics intersect.
- **Kadmon (2002)**: dedicates substantial discussion to presuppositions and focus association; 
- **Potts (2005)**: examines conventional implicatures and argues they represent a unique aspect of semantics. 

## Grice's Conversational Implicatures 

### Is natural language logical? 

Logical operators (e.g., `∧` for "and," `∨` for "or") are often assumed to differ from their natural language counterparts.

What does *and* mean in English? 

1. Mary got married and had a baby.
2. Mary had a baby and got married.
3. Mary got married. She had a baby.
4. Mary got married and had a baby, although not in that order.

What does *or* mean in English?

5. Chomsky is a linguist or a psychologist.
6. Either there is no bathroom, or it is on the second floor.

What does *not* mean in English?

8. It is not DELICIOUS; it's amazing!
9. I have not held THREE jobs previously, but four.

Some view natural language as vague and imprecise, regarding logical language as a more refined and structured alternative. Others argue that natural language, while distinct from formal logic, is richer and not inherently inferior, advocating for the study of "natural logic" as a discipline separate from formal logic.

Grice does not align with either side of this debate; instead, he questions a shared presupposition underlying it.
- The meanings of standard logical operators closely resemble those of their natural language counterparts.
- The widespread belief to the contrary stems from a failure to differentiate between semantics and pragmatics
  - the literal semantic content of a sentence ("what is literally said");
  - the various pragmatic inferences that can be drawn from the speaker's use of that sentence in a given context.

### Gricean maxims

Conversational partners typically acknowledge a shared purpose in their dialogue. At any given moment, certain "conversational moves" are deemed appropriate or inappropriate for achieving their mutual objectives.

#### Cooperative Principle
People should contribute to a conversation in a way that's appropriate for the purpose of the exchange. It's based on the idea that speakers and listeners follow conversational maxims to make interactions meaningful and constructive.

- **Maxims of Quantity**: (a) Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the
exchange). (b) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
- **Maxims of Quality**: Try to make your contribution one that is true. (a) Do not say what you believe to be false. (b) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
- **Maxim of Relation**: Be relevant.
- **Maxims of Manner**: Be perspicuous: (a) Avoid obscurity of expression. (b) Avoid ambiguity. (c) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). (d) Be orderly.

In addition to conversational maxims, there are other principles—such as aesthetic, social, or moral guidelines—that may influence conversational exchanges, including maxims like "Be polite."

### Generating Conversational Implicature

Grice's maxims provide an initial framework for *formalizing* the reasoning by which a hearer may infer that a speaker is conveying more than what is explicitly stated---an idea central to **conversational implicature**, which refers to information implied in a conversation but not directly expressed.

#### Quantity-based

10. Kyle to Ellen: “I have $9.”

> Conversational Implicature: Kyle does not have more than $9. <br>
> - (a). Contextual premise: Both Kyle and Ellen need $10 for their movie tickets. <br>
> - (b). Contextual premise: It is mutual, public information that Kyle has complete knowledge of how much money he has on him.<br>
> - (c). Assume Kyle is cooperative at least insofar as he is obeying Quantity and Quality. <br>
> - (d). Then he will assert what is maximally relevant, informative, and true.<br>
> - (e). By (a), the proposition p that Kyle has $n for $9 < n \le 10$ is more informative and relevant in this context than the proposition that he has $9.<br>
> - (f). Therefore, Kyle must lack sufficient evidence to assert p.<br>
> - (g). By (b), he must lack evidence for p because it is false.
>
> The implicature is heavily dependent upon the contextual assumptions: If the tickets cost $9 rather than $10, then “I have $9” is as informative as is required. So, (e) is false, and the implicature cannot be derived.

#### Relevance-based

11. Which city does Sue live in? ---- She lives in California.

> Conversational Implicature: The addressee does not know which city Sue lives in.
> - (a). Contextual premise: The addressee is willing to talk about Sue’s personal life.
> - (b). Assume the addressee is cooperative.
> - (c). Assume, towards a contradiction, that B does know which city Sue lives in (the negation of the implicature).
> - (d). Supplying the city’s name would do better on Relevance and Quantity than supplying just the country name.
> - (e). The contextual assumption is that B will supply such information.
> - (f). This contradicts the cooperativity assumption (b).
> - (g). We can therefore conclude that the implicature is true.
>
> If the conversational participants are planning a trip but have already sworn off visiting California, then the addressee’s answer might contain exactly the needed information, namely, that they won’t be visiting Sue. In this case, premise (d) does not hold, so the calculation doesn’t go through. 

#### Manner-based

12. Well, this presentation was ... interesting.

> Conversational Implicature: they did not actually find the presentation engaging.
> - (a). Assume the speaker is cooperative.
> - (b). There are less obscure words, like *clear*, *organized*, and *engaging*, competing with *interesting*.
> - (c). If the speaker found the presentation clear, organized, or engaging, she would use these words.
> - (d). This contradicts with (a).
> - (e). The implicature must be true.

### Understanding Conversational Implicature helps semantics

Intuitively, natural language or is frequently interpreted in an "exclusive" sense, meaning "one or the other, but not both." We can easily write a truth-table for exclusive *or*, which we will represent with the symbol ‘∨+’.

| **p** | **q** | **p ∨ q** | **p ∨+ q** | 
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
|   T   |   T   |     T     |   F   |   
|   T   |   F   |     T     |   T   |   
|   F   |   T   |     T     |   T   |   
|   F   |   F   |     F     |   F   |   

Issues: 
- Is English *or* truly semantically ambiguous between two distinct truth-conditional connectives?
- Can it be consistently analyzed as inclusive disjunction, with the apparent exceptions explained through pragmatic factors?

Let's try the conversational implicature approach: 

13. Sue has a dog or a cat.

> Conversational Implicature: Sue has a dog or a cat, but not both. (Exclusive *or*)
> - (a). Assume that the speaker is cooperative.
> - (b). Given Maxim of Quantity, if the speaker had evidence that Mary has a dog *and* a cat, she could have made the stronger statement: *Sue has a dog AND a cat*.
> - (c). This contradicts the speaker's performance.
> - (d). It implies that the speaker believes that Sue does not have both.

An argument from negation: 

14. Sue does not have a dog or a cat.

> If *or* were truly ambiguous between inclusive and exclusive meanings, its negation would also be expected to exhibit ambiguity. For instance, (14) should have an interpretation asserting that Mary has either neither or both. However, (14) unambiguously conveys the negation of the inclusive or, asserting instead that Mary has neither.
