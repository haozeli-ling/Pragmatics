# Layers of of pragmatic enrichment

Pragmatics explores how we expand the conventional meanings of spoken and written language into their richer, intended interpretations. In this course, we will examine the principles that drive this process of enrichment, paying particular attention to how systematic and universal these principles are.

# Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics

The term "pragmatics" was introduced by Charles Morris in 1938. As part of semiotics, the broader study of signs, Morris identified three distinct branches: 
- **Syntax**: Examines how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
  - Concerned with well-formedness and structural relationships.
- **Semantics**: Focuses on meaning, such as truth conditions, reference, and logical form.
  - Example: "All cats are mammals" is true if every individual cat is a mammal.
- **Pragmatics**: Explores how context influences meaning, including speaker intentions and assumptions.
  - Example: The phrase "Can you open the window?" pragmatically implies a request rather than a question about ability.

Recent research has increasingly questioned the rigid separation between semantics and pragmatics suggested by the traditional trichotomy. The field of formal pragmatics specifically addresses areas where semantics and pragmatics intersect.
- **Kadmon (2002)**: dedicates substantial discussion to presuppositions and focus association; 
- **Potts (2005)**: examines conventional implicatures and argues they represent a unique aspect of semantics. 

# Grice's Conversational Implicatures 

## Is natural language logical? 

Logical operators (e.g., `∧` for "and," `∨` for "or") are often assumed to differ from their natural language counterparts. 

What does *and* mean in natural language? 

1. Mary got married and had a baby.
2. Mary had a baby and got married.
3. Mary got married. She had a baby.
4. Mary got married and had a baby, although not in that order. 

Some view natural language as vague and imprecise, regarding logical language as a more refined and structured alternative. Others argue that natural language, while distinct from formal logic, is richer and not inherently inferior, advocating for the study of "natural logic" as a discipline separate from formal logic.
