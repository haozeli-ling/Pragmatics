# Layers of of pragmatic enrichment

Pragmatics explores how we expand the conventional meanings of spoken and written language into their richer, intended interpretations. In this course, we will examine the principles that drive this process of enrichment, paying particular attention to how systematic and universal these principles are.

## Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics

The term "pragmatics" was introduced by Charles Morris in 1938. As part of semiotics, the broader study of signs, Morris identified three distinct branches: 
- **Syntax**: Examines how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
  - Concerned with well-formedness and structural relationships.
- **Semantics**: Focuses on meaning, such as truth conditions, reference, and logical form.
  - Example: "All cats are mammals" is true if every individual cat is a mammal.
- **Pragmatics**: Explores how context influences meaning, including speaker intentions and assumptions.
  - Example: The phrase "Can you open the window?" pragmatically implies a request rather than a question about ability.

Recent research has increasingly questioned the rigid separation between semantics and pragmatics suggested by the traditional trichotomy. The field of formal pragmatics specifically addresses areas where semantics and pragmatics intersect.
- **Kadmon (2002)**: dedicates substantial discussion to presuppositions and focus association; 
- **Potts (2005)**: examines conventional implicatures and argues they represent a unique aspect of semantics. 

## Grice's Conversational Implicatures 

### Is natural language logical? 

Logical operators (e.g., `∧` for "and," `∨` for "or") are often assumed to differ from their natural language counterparts.

What does *and* mean in English? 

1. Mary got married and had a baby.
2. Mary had a baby and got married.
3. Mary got married. She had a baby.
4. Mary got married and had a baby, although not in that order.

What does *or* mean in English?

5. Chomsky is a linguist or a psychologist.
6. Either there is no bathroom, or it is on the second floor.

What does *not* mean in English?

8. It is not DELICIOUS; it's amazing!
9. I have not held THREE jobs previously, but four.

Some view natural language as vague and imprecise, regarding logical language as a more refined and structured alternative. Others argue that natural language, while distinct from formal logic, is richer and not inherently inferior, advocating for the study of "natural logic" as a discipline separate from formal logic.

Grice does not align with either side of this debate; instead, he questions a shared presupposition underlying it.
- The meanings of standard logical operators closely resemble those of their natural language counterparts.
- The widespread belief to the contrary stems from a failure to differentiate between semantics and pragmatics
  - the literal semantic content of a sentence ("what is literally said");
  - the various pragmatic inferences that can be drawn from the speaker's use of that sentence in a given context.

### Gricean maxims

Conversational partners typically acknowledge a shared purpose in their dialogue. At any given moment, certain "conversational moves" are deemed appropriate or inappropriate for achieving their mutual objectives.

#### Cooperative Principle
People should contribute to a conversation in a way that's appropriate for the purpose of the exchange. It's based on the idea that speakers and listeners follow conversational maxims to make interactions meaningful and constructive.

- **Maxims of Quantity**: (a) Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the
exchange). (b) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
- **Maxims of Quality**: Try to make your contribution one that is true. (a) Do not say what you believe to be false. (b) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
- **Maxim of Relation**: Be relevant.
- **Maxims of Manner**: Be perspicuous: (a) Avoid obscurity of expression. (b) Avoid ambiguity. (c) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). (d) Be orderly.

In addition to conversational maxims, there are other principles—such as aesthetic, social, or moral guidelines—that may influence conversational exchanges, including maxims like "Be polite."
