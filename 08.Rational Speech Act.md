# The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of **recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener**. In this framework, the listener interprets the speakerâ€™s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. Using probability inference, the listener evaluates the likely state of the world based on the speaker's utterance, taking into account that the speaker has reasoned about how the listener would interpret that utterance. 

## Basics

We have a speaker and a listener operating within a shared context or game. The speaker aims to convey a target piece of information, $s$, and their goal is to select an utterance that will guide the listener to correctly identify $s$ as the intended target.

There are (at least) three levels of inference.
