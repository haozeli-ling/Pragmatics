# The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of **recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener**. In this framework, the listener interprets the speakerâ€™s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. 

Using statistcal inference, the listener evaluates the likely state of the world based on the speaker's utterance, taking into account that the speaker has reasoned about how the listener would interpret that utterance.
