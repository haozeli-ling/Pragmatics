# The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener. In this framework, the listener interprets the speaker’s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. Using Bayesian inference, the listener evaluates the likely state of the world based on the speaker's utterance, taking into account that the speaker has reasoned about how the listener would interpret that utterance. 

This results in (at least) three levels of inference. At the highest level, the sophisticated, pragmatic listener (\(L_1\)) reasons about the pragmatic speaker (\(S_1\)) and infers the state of the world (\(s\)) given the speaker’s choice of utterance (\(u\)). The speaker, in turn, selects \(u\) to maximize the probability that a naive, literal listener (\(L_0\)) would correctly deduce the state of the world (\(s\)) based on the literal meaning of \(u\).
