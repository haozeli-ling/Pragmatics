# Issues of the Gricean approach

## Alternatives

According to the Gricean approach, scalar alternatives are determined lexically. 

> - *Some* evokes scalar alternatives including *most*, *every*, and *all*.
> - *Or* evokes a scalar alternative *and*.
> - *Good* evokes a scalar alternative *best*.

However, this assumption is far from sufficient to explain scalar implicatures observed in natural languages. 

1. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **many** of hers.
2. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **all** of hers.
3. #I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **just some** of hers.  

Sentences 1 and 2 sound natural. In these examples, the first sentences generate the scalar implicatures "I didn't grade many of my assignments" and "I didn't grade all of my assignments," respectively. These implicatures establish the contrast that makes the two sentences felicitous.

However, Sentence 3 is not natural. It is beyond the prediction of the Gricean approach. 


## Embedded Implicatures

Gricean derivations of Conversational Implicatures only apply at the utterance level. 

However, conversational implicatures, especially scalar implicatures, can appear even under logical operators (Chierchia 2004, Chierchia, Fox & Spector 2011, etc.). 

1. If you order a starter or a dessert with your meal, you'll pay S$12. If you order both, you'll pay S$15.
2. The student is under the impression that she is required to take syntax or semantics.
