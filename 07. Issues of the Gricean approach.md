# Issues of the Gricean approach

## Alternatives

According to the Gricean approach, scalar alternatives are determined lexically. 

> - *Some* evokes scalar alternatives including *most*, *every*, and *all*.
> - *Or* evokes a scalar alternative *and*.
> - *Good* evokes a scalar alternative *best*.

However, this assumption is overly restrictive. Scalar implicatures are not solely derived from lexically defined scalar alternatives but are also influenced by context [(Matsumoto 1995)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00984960).

1. Yesterday it was warm. Today it is a little bit more than warm. <br> 
   $\leadsto$ Yesterday, it was not a little bit more than warm. 

## Embedded Implicatures

Gricean derivations of Conversational Implicatures only apply at the utterance level. 

However, conversational implicatures, especially scalar implicatures, can appear even under logical operators (Chierchia 2004, Chierchia, Fox & Spector 2011, etc.). 

1. If you order a starter or a dessert with your meal, you'll pay S$12. If you order both, you'll pay S$15.
2. The student is under the impression that she is required to take syntax or semantics.
