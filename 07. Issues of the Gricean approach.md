# Issues of the Gricean approach

## Ambiguity and under-specification

Gricean reasoning relies on intuitions about what is "relevant" or "informative" without clearly defining these concepts in a way that can be universally applied. The maxims can be ambiguousâ€”different interlocutors might prioritize or interpret them differently. This under-specification can lead to circular explanations where the maxims themselves require further clarification. 

Consider the following example:

1. We're running out of gas.

During a road trip to Death Valley, Peter said 1, signaling that they needed to find the nearest gas station immediately. 

By contrast, while driving in a city with plenty of gas stations, Peter used the utterance, which might have simply indicated that his fuel was low.


## What are the relevant scalar alternatives

According to the Gricean approach, scalar alternatives are determined lexically. 

> - *Some* evokes scalar alternatives including *most*, *every*, and *all*.
> - *Or* evokes a scalar alternative *and*.
> - *Good* evokes a scalar alternative *best*.

However, this assumption is far from sufficient to explain scalar implicatures observed in natural languages. 

1. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **many** of hers.
2. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **all** of hers.
3. #I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **just some** of hers.  

Sentences 1 and 2 sound natural. In these examples, the first sentences generate the scalar implicatures "I didn't grade many of my assignments" and "I didn't grade all of my assignments," respectively. These implicatures establish the contrast that makes the two sentences felicitous.

However, Sentence 3 is not natural. It is beyond the prediction of the Gricean approach. 

> - If *some* forms a scale with *just some*, the first sentence would generate a scalar implicature like 'I didn't grade just some of my assignments'. <br>
> - When combined with the scalar implicature, the first sentence conveys the meaning, "I graded some, but not merely some, of my assignments," which could imply "I graded many or all of my assignments." This interpretation should align with the meaning of the second sentence.
> - This problem could be resolved by prohibiting *just some* from forming a scale with *some*.
> - However, why?  

Consider *or* again. A disjunctive sentence does not raise a conjunctive implicature. 

4. The emperor lives in the Forbidden City or the Summer Palace. <br>
   $\leadsto$ The emperor lives in the Forbidden City or the Summer Palace, but not both. <br>
   $\not\leadsto$ The emperor lives in the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace.
   
However, there is no constraint preventing exclusive disjunction $\underline{\vee}$ to be an alternative to inclusive disjunction $\vee$. If $\underline{\vee}$ formed a scale with $\vee$, a conjunctive implicature would be expected.

## Embedded Implicatures

Gricean derivations of Conversational Implicatures only apply at the utterance level. 

However, conversational implicatures, especially scalar implicatures, can appear even under logical operators (Chierchia 2004, Chierchia, Fox & Spector 2011, etc.). 

5. If you order a starter or a dessert with your meal, you'll pay S$12. If you order both, you'll pay S$15.
6. The student is under the impression that she is required to take syntax or semantics.
