# Issues of the Gricean approach


### Conceptual issues

- Although Grice proposed four maxims, are there only four?
- Can there be more?
- What motivates these maxims?
- Is there a single, fundamental principle underlying them?  

--- 

### Contextual dependency

It has been demonstrated that conversational implicature is highly context-dependent. However, in many cases, Gricean reasoning does not offer a sufficiently rigorous framework to precisely account for these contextual dependencies. 


#### Under-specification 
Gricean reasoning relies on intuitions about what is "relevant" or "informative" without clearly defining these concepts in a way that can be universally applied. The maxims can be ambiguous—different interlocutors might prioritize or interpret them differently. This under-specification can lead to circular explanations where the maxims themselves require further clarification. 

Consider the following example:

1. We're running out of gas.

- During a road trip to Death Valley, Peter said 1, signaling that they needed to find the nearest gas station immediately. 
- By contrast, while driving in a city with plenty of gas stations, Peter used the utterance, which might have simply indicated that his fuel was low.

#### Fine-grained interactions

[Goodman & Stuhlmüller's (2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/tops.12007) experiments

Consider the following scenario and utterance. 

Letters to Laura’s company almost always have checks inside. Today Laura received 3 letters. Laura tells you on the phone: 

2. “I have looked at 2 of the 3 letters. Some of the letters have checks inside.”

Can you still get the implicature "some but not ALL the letters checks inside"? 

What if Laura had a full knoweledge about the letters? 

3. “I have looked at 3 of the 3 letters. Some of the letters have checks inside.”

Experimental results:

- Participants interpreted statements like “Some of the apples are red” under different conditions of speaker knowledge.
- The result demonstrated that, when the speaker had full knowledge, participants inferred “some but not all.”
- When the speaker had limited knowledge, the implicature was weaker or canceled.
  - While there was no significant implicature in either partial-access condition, there is a slightly greater tendency toward implicature in the access 2 condition than the access 1 condition. 

The pattern of numerial expressions is even more intriguing. 

Different contexts:

Letters to Laura’s company almost always have checks inside. Today Laura received 3 letters. Laura tells you on the phone: 

4. “I have looked at 1 of the 3 letters. 1 of the letters has checks inside.”
5. “I have looked at 2 of the 3 letters. 1 of the letters has checks inside.”
6. “I have looked at 2 of the 3 letters. 2 of the letters has checks inside.”
7. “I have looked at 3 of the 3 letters. 1 of the letters has checks inside.”
8. “I have looked at 3 of the 3 letters. 2 of the letters has checks inside.”
9. “I have looked at 3 of the 3 letters. 3 of the letters has checks inside.”

![Alt Text](https://github.com/haozeli-ling/Pragmatics/blob/main/GS_2013_2.png)

- Participants judged the meaning of numerical expressions in contexts where the speaker had different levels of knowledge.
- Results showed that when the speaker had complete access, listeners inferred exact meanings (e.g., "one" means "exactly one").
- When the speaker had partial access, this exact interpretation was weakened or canceled.
  - When access was 2 and Laura said “one”, a partial implicature was observed: "one" implies "one but not three", not necessarily "one but not two."

Discussion: Although Gricean reasoning may not provide a precise or quantative account for these patterns, can we still develop an intuitive understanding of them based solely on Grice’s maxims?

## What are the relevant scalar alternatives

According to the Gricean approach, scalar alternatives are determined lexically. 

> - *Some* evokes scalar alternatives including *most*, *every*, and *all*.
> - *Or* evokes a scalar alternative *and*.
> - *Good* evokes a scalar alternative *best*.

However, this assumption is far from sufficient to explain scalar implicatures observed in natural languages. 

1. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **many** of hers.
2. I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **all** of hers.
3. #I graded some of my assignments. Sue graded **just some** of hers.  

Sentences 1 and 2 sound natural. In these examples, the first sentences generate the scalar implicatures "I didn't grade many of my assignments" and "I didn't grade all of my assignments," respectively. These implicatures establish the contrast that makes the two sentences felicitous.

However, Sentence 3 is not natural. It is beyond the prediction of the Gricean approach. 

> - If *some* forms a scale with *just some*, the first sentence would generate a scalar implicature like 'I didn't grade just some of my assignments'. <br>
> - When combined with the scalar implicature, the first sentence conveys the meaning, "I graded some, but not merely some, of my assignments," which could imply "I graded many or all of my assignments." This interpretation should align with the meaning of the second sentence.
> - This problem could be resolved by prohibiting *just some* from forming a scale with *some*.
> - However, why?  

Consider *or* again. A disjunctive sentence does not raise a conjunctive implicature. 

4. The emperor lives in the Forbidden City or the Summer Palace. <br>
   $\leadsto$ The emperor lives in the Forbidden City or the Summer Palace, but not both. <br>
   $\not\leadsto$ The emperor lives in the Forbidden City and the Summer Palace.
   
However, there is no constraint preventing exclusive disjunction $\underline{\vee}$ to be an alternative to inclusive disjunction $\vee$. If $\underline{\vee}$ formed a scale with $\vee$, a conjunctive implicature would be expected.

Discussion: Do you see why?
