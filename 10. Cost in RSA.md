# Cost in RSA

The **cost** term in the utility function plays a crucial role in shaping the choices of the pragmatic speaker. 

$\text{Utility}'(u, s) = \ln (P_{L_0})(s \mid u) - \text{Cost}'(u)$

$\text{Cost}'(u)$ captures the **effort or "penalty"** associated with producing the utterance.

### Effects of the Cost Term

#### Encourages simpler but more efficient utterances

- **High-cost utterances** are penalized, making the speaker less likely to choose them, even if they are informative.
- **Low-cost utterances** are preferred if they can adequately convey the intended situation.

> **Example** <br>
> - Saying "red" to describe a color is low-cost (short, familiar).
> - Saying "the reddish, slightly orangish hue that resembles a sunset" is high-cost (long, complex), so it would only be chosen if it conveys significantly more information.

Cost penalizes unnecessarily long or detailed utterances. Without the cost term, the speaker might always prefer highly specific utterances, even when they’re not needed. 

- Instead of saying "apple," the speaker might say "a green apple that is slightly sour and about 3 inches wide."
- Adding $\text{Cost}'(u)$ discourages this verbosity unless the extra detail provides a significant gain in informativeness.

This aligns with the **principle of efficiency** in communication: speakers balance being informative with minimizing effort.

#### Trade-off between informativeness and effort

The cost term forces the speaker to balance two competing goals:

- **Informativeness**: How well does the utterance distinguish the intended meaning \(s\) from other possible meanings?
- **Effort/Cost**: How difficult is it to produce the utterance (in terms of length, complexity, or social factors)?

> **Example**
> A speaker might say "blue" (low-cost, moderately informative) instead of "the very deep navy blue you find in midnight skies" (high-cost, more precise). <br>
> However, if precision is critical, the speaker might accept the cost of the longer utterance.

Imagine the speaker choosing between two utterances to describe a small object:

- $u_1 =$ 'small': $\ln P_{L_0}(s \mid u_1) = -0.5$, $\text{Cost}'(u_1) = 1$
- $u_2 =$ 'tiny, minuscule, and compact': $\ln P_{L_0}(s \mid u_2) = -0.2$, $\text{Cost}(u_2) = 3$
- $\text{Utility}'(u_1) = -0.5 - 1 = -1.5$
- $\text{Utility}'(u_2) = -0.2 - 3 = -3.2$

Even though $u_2$ is more informative, its higher cost makes $u_1$ the preferred utterance.

#### Accounts for social and cognitive factors
Cost isn’t limited to physical effort (e.g., utterance length). It can also represent **social, cognitive, or contextual penalties**:

- **Social Norms**: Some phrases might be seen as overly formal or informal in certain settings, increasing their "cost."
- **Cognitive Load**: Complex utterances that are hard to process for listeners may be avoided.
- **Contextual Constraints**: In time-sensitive situations, shorter utterances might have lower cost due to urgency.

---

#### Reduces Ambiguity in Utterance Choice**
The cost term helps prevent over-reliance on highly informative but rarely used utterances. 

- Saying "scarlet" might be more precise than "red," but it’s rarely used and cognitively costly for both the speaker and the listener.
- With cost factored in, the speaker would prefer "red" unless the context specifically demands more precision.
