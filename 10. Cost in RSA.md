# Cost in RSA

The **cost** term in the utility function plays a crucial role in shaping the choices of the pragmatic speaker. 

$\text{Utility}'(u, s) = \ln (P_{L_0})(s \mid u) - \text{Cost}'(u)$

$\text{Cost}'(u)$ captures the **effort or "penalty"** associated with producing the utterance.

### Effects of the Cost Term

#### Encourages simpler but more efficient utterances

- **High-cost utterances** are penalized, making the speaker less likely to choose them, even if they are informative.
- **Low-cost utterances** are preferred if they can adequately convey the intended situation.

> **Example** <br>
> - Saying "red" to describe a color is low-cost (short, familiar).
> - Saying "the reddish, slightly orangish hue that resembles a sunset" is high-cost (long, complex), so it would only be chosen if it conveys significantly more information.

This aligns with the **principle of efficiency** in communication: speakers balance being informative with minimizing effort.

#### 2. **Trade-off Between Informativeness and Effort**
The cost term forces the speaker to balance two competing goals:
- **Informativeness**: How well does the utterance distinguish the intended meaning \(s\) from other possible meanings?
- **Effort/Cost**: How difficult is it to produce the utterance (in terms of length, complexity, or social factors)?

For instance:
- A speaker might say "blue" (low-cost, moderately informative) instead of "the very deep navy blue you find in midnight skies" (high-cost, more precise).
- However, if precision is critical, the speaker might accept the cost of the longer utterance.

---

#### 3. **Discourages Overly Specific or Verbose Utterances**
Cost penalizes unnecessarily long or detailed utterances. Without the cost term, the speaker might always prefer highly specific utterances, even when they’re not needed. For example:
- Instead of saying "apple," the speaker might say "a green apple that is slightly sour and about 3 inches wide."
- Adding \(\text{Cost}(u)\) discourages this verbosity unless the extra detail provides a significant gain in informativeness.

---

#### 4. **Accounts for Social and Cognitive Factors**
Cost isn’t limited to physical effort (e.g., utterance length). It can also represent **social, cognitive, or contextual penalties**:
- **Social Norms**: Some phrases might be seen as overly formal or informal in certain settings, increasing their "cost."
- **Cognitive Load**: Complex utterances that are hard to process for listeners may be avoided.
- **Contextual Constraints**: In time-sensitive situations, shorter utterances might have lower cost due to urgency.

For example:
- In casual speech, "yeah" (low-cost) might suffice, whereas in a formal setting, "Yes, I completely agree" (higher-cost) might be more appropriate.

---

#### 5. **Reduces Ambiguity in Utterance Choice**
The cost term helps prevent over-reliance on highly informative but rarely used utterances. For example:
- Saying "vermillion" (a very specific shade of red) might be more precise than "red," but it’s rarely used and cognitively costly for both the speaker and the listener.
- With cost factored in, the speaker would prefer "red" unless the context specifically demands more precision.

### **Examples of Cost Effects**

#### **Case 1: Length-Based Cost**
Imagine the speaker choosing between two utterances to describe a small object:
- \( u_1 = \text{"small"} \): \(\log P_{L_0}(s \mid u_1) = 2\), \(\text{Cost}(u_1) = 1\)
- \( u_2 = \text{"tiny, minuscule, and compact"} \): \(\log P_{L_0}(s \mid u_2) = 3\), \(\text{Cost}(u_2) = 3\)

Utility calculations:
- \( \text{Utility}(u_1) = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
- \( \text{Utility}(u_2) = 3 - 3 = 0 \)

Even though \( u_2 \) is more informative, its higher cost makes \( u_1 \) the preferred utterance.

---

#### **Case 2: Social Cost**
Imagine the context is casual speech:
- \( u_1 = \text{"Sure"} \): \(\log P_{L_0}(s \mid u_1) = 1.5\), \(\text{Cost}(u_1) = 0.5\)
- \( u_2 = \text{"I would be delighted to assist you"} \): \(\log P_{L_0}(s \mid u_2) = 2\), \(\text{Cost}(u_2) = 2\)

Utility calculations:
- \( \text{Utility}(u_1) = 1.5 - 0.5 = 1.0 \)
- \( \text{Utility}(u_2) = 2 - 2 = 0 \)

Here, the formal utterance \( u_2 \) is penalized heavily due to social context, making \( u_1 \) more appropriate.

---

### **Summary of Cost Effects**
1. **Encourages Efficiency**: Speakers favor shorter, simpler utterances when they are sufficiently informative.
2. **Balances Informativeness and Effort**: High-cost utterances are chosen only when their extra informativeness outweighs their cost.
3. **Discourages Verbosity**: Prevents the speaker from being overly specific unless necessary.
4. **Incorporates Real-World Constraints**: Accounts for physical effort, cognitive load, and social appropriateness.

The cost term ensures that communication remains practical, reflecting the trade-offs speakers make in real-world scenarios. Would you like to dive deeper into specific types of costs or see a visualization of how cost affects choice probabilities?
