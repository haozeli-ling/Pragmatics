# The exponential function in RSA

$P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{\text{exp}(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s))}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ \text{exp}(\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s))}$

$\text{Utility}'$ is a measure of how effective an utterance $u$ is for communicating a state $s$, but **utility itself isn’t a probability**.

The exponential function ...  

- Ensures that higher utility values translate to higher probabilities.
- Provides a non-linear scaling, where small differences in utility are magnified, which is especially useful in capturing human-like decision-making.

This is particularly important in RSA, where the speaker chooses utterances probabilistically, rather than deterministically picking the highest-utility option.

Suppose that Mary has just tasted a milk tea. The milk tea is is very good, but not perfect. So, Mary can choose among these utterances:

1. The milk tea is amazing.
2. The milk tea is good.
3. The milk tea is ok.

All three utterances are true in this situation. 

Let's assume the following utilities: 

|  Utterance  |  Informativeness   | Cost | Utility |
| ------- | -------| ------ | ------ |
| 'amazing' | -0.1 | 0 | -0.1 |
| 'good' | -1.2 | 0 | -1.1 |

If the decision is made based on the hard maximization of utilities, the speaker would choose one utterance whose utility is strictly highest among all alternatives. As a consequence, they would never use 'good'.

### Soft-maximization

The RSA speaker does not always choose the single highest-utility utterance. Instead, the use of the exponential function allows for soft-maximization, where:

- Higher-utility utterances are more likely to be chosen, but lower-utility utterances are still possible.
- This probabilistic behavior aligns better with real-world human communication, where speakers sometimes use less-than-optimal utterances due to noise, cognitive constraints, or contextual factors.

### Ensures probabilities are positive

The plot above visually contrasts the **exponential function (used in RSA) vs. a simple linear probability distribution**.

**Differences:**

1. **Exponential Distribution (Solid Line)**
   - Small differences in utility are **amplified**, causing a **sharp increase** in probability for higher-utility utterances.
   - The highest-utility utterances dominate, but lower-utility utterances still have **some** probability.
   - The curve is **non-linear**, meaning that as utility increases, probability **rises exponentially**.

2. **Linear Probability Distribution (Dashed Line)**
   - Probabilities increase **gradually and evenly** with utility.
   - The highest-utility utterance is **not strongly favored**, meaning **small differences in utility result in only small differences in probability**.
   - This makes the model **less sensitive to utility differences**, causing more **randomness** in utterance selection.

**Why This Matters in RSA:**
- The **exponential function** allows for a **gradient preference**—it **smoothly** shifts from probabilistic choice (small $\alpha$) to near-deterministic choice (large $\alpha$).
- The **linear model lacks this flexibility**, treating all utility increases **equally** and failing to reflect strong speaker preferences.
