# Question Under Discussion (QUD)

The Question under Discussion (QUD) framework, developed by [Craige Roberts (2012)](https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.5.6), provides a structured way to analyze discourse. QUD posits that conversations are organized around explicit or implicit questions guiding the flow of information. Understanding QUD helps explain relevance, focus, and coherence in natural discourse.

### Key concepts

**Discourse as a Strategy for Inquiry**: Conversations proceed as an attempt to resolve open issues.

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m thinking of taking a vacation next month." <br>
> B: "Where are you planning to go?" <br>
> A: "I’m considering either Hawaii or Italy." <br>
> B: "What’s your budget for the trip?" <br>
> A: "I’m aiming for around $2,000." <br>
> B: "Then Hawaii might be a better option—flights to Italy are more expensive." <br>

> Open Issues (QUDs): <br>
> "Where is A planning to go on vacation?", 
> "What is A’s budget for the trip?", 
> "Which destination fits A’s budget?"

> Resolution: The conversation progresses by addressing each QUD, ultimately resolving the issue of where A should go on vacation.


**Explicit vs. Implicit Questions**: Some questions are directly asked, while others remain implicit but shape how statements are interpreted. 

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m so tired today." <br>
> B: "You should go to bed earlier." <br>

> Implicit QUD: "Why are you so tired?" <br>
> Speaker A’s statement "I’m so tired today" implicitly raises the question, "Why are you so tired?" <br> 
> Speaker B’s response, "You should go to bed earlier," directly addresses this implicit QUD by suggesting a reason (lack of sleep) and a solution.

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m starving!" <br>
> B: "Let’s grab a pizza."

> Implicit QUD: "What should we do about your hunger?" <br>
> Speaker A’s statement "I’m starving!" implicitly raises the question, "What should we do about your hunger?" <br> 
> Speaker B’s response, "Let’s grab a pizza," directly addresses this implicit QUD by proposing a solution.

**Discourse Structure**: Utterances must be understood in relation to the broader conversational goal (i.e., the QUD).

### The Structure of QUD

A discourse consists of a stack of QUDs that guide what counts as relevant information. Each utterance should address the current QUD in a way that contributes to discourse coherence.

The QUD hierarchy can be represented as a tree:

- The root QUD represents the overarching topic.
- Sub-QUDs represent more fine-grained inquiries branching from the main question.

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "We need to schedule a team meeting this week." <br>
> B: "What’s the purpose of the meeting?" <br>
> A: "To finalize the project timeline." <br>
> B: "Who needs to be there?" <br>
> A: "Just the core team—John, Sarah, and me." <br>
> B: "How about Thursday at 2 PM?" <br>
> A: "That works for me. I’ll check with John and Sarah."

```
        Main QUD: "When should we schedule the team meeting?"

        ----------------------------------------
        |                |                       |
Sub-QUD 1:         Sub-QUD 2:                Sub-QUD 3:  
"What’s the       "Who needs to            "What time works  
purpose of the    be there?"               for everyone?"  
meeting?"  
        |               |                        |
Utterance:        Utterance:              Utterance:  
"To finalize      "Just the core          "How about Thursday  
the project       team—John,              at 2 PM?"  
timeline."       Sarah, and me."  
                                                 |
        Resolution: "Thursday at 2 PM works. I’ll check with John and Sarah."
```

### Relevance

An utterance is relevant in a conversation if it directly or indirectly contributes to resolving the current Question Under Discussion (QUD). Relevance is determined by the relationship between the utterance and the QUD.

- **QUD-Addressing**: An utterance is **relevant** if it provides a partial or complete answer to the current QUD. If it does not address the QUD, it risks being perceived as off-topic or uninformative.
   
- **QUD-Coherence**: Contributions to discourse must maintain coherence by connecting to an existing or implicit QUD. Even if a response does not directly answer a question, it should at least introduce a sub-QUD that progresses the conversation logically.

- **Implicit and Explicit Relevance**: While some statements explicitly answer a QUD (e.g., “Where is John?” → “John is at the library”), others are implicitly relevant by introducing necessary background information (e.g., “I saw his bag at the library”).

- **Hierarchical Relevance**: Since QUDs are structured hierarchically, an utterance may be relevant not only to the immediate QUD but also to a higher-level QUD in the discourse structure.

**Examples** 

Here are concrete examples to illustrate **QUD-Addressing** in the QUD framework:

A Relevant Response

> A: Where is John? (*QUD: Where is John?*) <br>
> B: He’s at the library. (*Directly answers the QUD → Relevant.*) 

B’s response provides a complete answer to the QUD.

A Partially Relevant Response

> A: Where is John? (*QUD: Where is John?*) <br>
> B: He was at the library earlier. (*Partially addresses the QUD but leaves some uncertainty.*)

While B's response does not completely answer the question, it provides useful information related to the QUD.

An Irrelevant Response

> A: Where is John? (*QUD: Where is John?*) <br>
> B: I really like coffee. (*Completely unrelated → Off-topic and irrelevant.*)

B’s response does not address the QUD in any way and appears incoherent in the given discourse.

A Response That Shifts the QUD

> A: Where is John? (*QUD: Where is John?*) <br>
> B: He had a meeting at 3 PM. (*Introduces a sub-QUD: “Where would John be for his 3 PM meeting?”)*

While B does not directly answer the QUD, their response suggests information that may help infer the answer.

In summary, in the QUD framework, an utterance is **relevant** if it meaningfully contributes to answering the current question under discussion, either by resolving it directly or by introducing necessary sub-questions to progress the discourse.
