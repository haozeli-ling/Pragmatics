# Question Under Discussion (QUD)

The Question under Discussion (QUD) framework, developed by [Craige Roberts (2012)](https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.5.6), provides a structured way to analyze discourse. QUD posits that conversations are organized around explicit or implicit questions guiding the flow of information. Understanding QUD helps explain relevance, coherence, and implicature in natural discourse.

The QUD is the **explicit or implicit** question that a conversation is addressing at any given moment.
