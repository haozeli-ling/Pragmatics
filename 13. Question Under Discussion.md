# Question Under Discussion (QUD)

The Question under Discussion (QUD) framework, developed by [Craige Roberts (2012)](https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.5.6), provides a structured way to analyze discourse. QUD posits that conversations are organized around explicit or implicit questions guiding the flow of information. Understanding QUD helps explain relevance, focus, and coherence in natural discourse.

### Key concepts

Discourse as a Strategy for Inquiry: Conversations proceed as an attempt to resolve open issues.

> Conversation:
>
> A: "I’m thinking of taking a vacation next month."
> B: "Where are you planning to go?"
> A: "I’m considering either Hawaii or Italy."
> B: "What’s your budget for the trip?"
> A: "I’m aiming for around $2,000."
> B: "Then Hawaii might be a better option—flights to Italy are more expensive."

> Open Issues (QUDs):
>
> "Where is A planning to go on vacation?"
> "What is A’s budget for the trip?"
> "Which destination fits A’s budget?"

> Resolution: The conversation progresses by addressing each QUD, ultimately resolving the issue of where A should go on vacation.



Explicit vs. Implicit Questions: Some questions are directly asked, while others remain implicit but shape how statements are interpreted. 



The QUD is the **explicit or implicit** question that a conversation is addressing at any given moment.
