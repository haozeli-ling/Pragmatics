# Question Under Discussion (QUD)

The Question under Discussion (QUD) framework, developed by [Craige Roberts (2012)](https://semprag.org/index.php/sp/article/view/sp.5.6), provides a structured way to analyze discourse. QUD posits that conversations are organized around explicit or implicit questions guiding the flow of information. Understanding QUD helps explain relevance, focus, and coherence in natural discourse.

### Key concepts

**Discourse as a Strategy for Inquiry**: Conversations proceed as an attempt to resolve open issues.

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m thinking of taking a vacation next month." <br>
> B: "Where are you planning to go?" <br>
> A: "I’m considering either Hawaii or Italy." <br>
> B: "What’s your budget for the trip?" <br>
> A: "I’m aiming for around $2,000." <br>
> B: "Then Hawaii might be a better option—flights to Italy are more expensive." <br>

> Open Issues (QUDs): <br>
> "Where is A planning to go on vacation?", 
> "What is A’s budget for the trip?", 
> "Which destination fits A’s budget?"

> Resolution: The conversation progresses by addressing each QUD, ultimately resolving the issue of where A should go on vacation.


**Explicit vs. Implicit Questions**: Some questions are directly asked, while others remain implicit but shape how statements are interpreted. 

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m so tired today." <br>
> B: "You should go to bed earlier." <br>

> Implicit QUD: "Why are you so tired?" <br>
> Speaker A’s statement "I’m so tired today" implicitly raises the question, "Why are you so tired?" <br> 
> Speaker B’s response, "You should go to bed earlier," directly addresses this implicit QUD by suggesting a reason (lack of sleep) and a solution.

> Conversation: <br>
> A: "I’m starving!" <br>
> B: "Let’s grab a pizza."

> Implicit QUD: "What should we do about your hunger?" <br>
> Speaker A’s statement "I’m starving!" implicitly raises the question, "What should we do about your hunger?" <br> 
> Speaker B’s response, "Let’s grab a pizza," directly addresses this implicit QUD by proposing a solution.

**Discourse Structure**: Utterances must be understood in relation to the broader conversational goal (i.e., the QUD).

### The Structure of QUD

A discourse consists of a stack of QUDs that guide what counts as relevant information. Each utterance should address the current QUD in a way that contributes to discourse coherence.

The QUD hierarchy can be represented as a tree:

- The root QUD represents the overarching topic.
- Sub-QUDs represent more fine-grained inquiries branching from the main question.
