# Gricean maxims

Conversational partners typically acknowledge a shared purpose in their dialogue. At any given moment, certain "conversational moves" are deemed appropriate or inappropriate for achieving their mutual objectives.

## Cooperative Principle
People should contribute to a conversation in a way that's appropriate for the purpose of the exchange. It's based on the idea that speakers and listeners follow conversational maxims to make interactions meaningful and constructive.

- **Maxims of Quantity**: (a) Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the
exchange). (b) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
- **Maxims of Quality**: Try to make your contribution one that is true. (a) Do not say what you believe to be false. (b) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
- **Maxim of Relation**: Be relevant.
- **Maxims of Manner**: Be perspicuous: (a) Avoid obscurity of expression. (b) Avoid ambiguity. (c) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). (d) Be orderly.

In addition to conversational maxims, there are other principles—such as aesthetic, social, or moral guidelines—that may influence conversational exchanges, including maxims like "Be polite."

## Generating Conversational Implicature

Grice's maxims provide an initial framework for *formalizing* the reasoning by which a hearer may infer that a speaker is conveying more than what is explicitly stated---an idea central to **conversational implicature**, which refers to information implied in a conversation but not directly expressed.

### Quantity-based

Notation: the symbol $\leadsto$ signals a 'conversational implicature'. 

1. Kyle to Ellen: “I have $9.” <br>
   $\leadsto$ Kyle does not have more than $9.

Pragmatic derivation:

- Contextual premise: Both Kyle and Ellen need $10 for their movie tickets.
- Assume Kyle is cooperative at least insofar as he is obeying **the Maxim of Quantity** and **the Maxim of Quanlity**.
- Then he will assert what is maximally relevant, informative, and true.
- Given the context, Kyle should utter (a) rather than (b) if he had $10. Note that (a) is more informative than (b). 
  - (a) "I have $10"
  - (b) "I have $9"
- However, Kyle didn't utter (a).
- Given that Kyle is cooperative, Kyle must not have $10.
- As result, Kyle actually means: he has $9, but not $10.
- In other words, Kyle does not have more than $9.

The implicature is heavily dependent upon the contextual assumptions: If the tickets cost $9 rather than $10, then “I have $9” is as informative as is required. So, (e) is false, and the implicature cannot be derived.

### Relevance-based

2. A: Which city does Sue live in? <br>
   B: She lives in California. <br>
   $\leadsto$ The addressee does not know which city Sue lives in.
 
> - (a) Contextual premise: The addressee is willing to talk about Sue’s personal life.
> - (b) Assume the addressee is cooperative.
> - (c) Assume, towards a contradiction, that B does know which city Sue lives in (the negation of the implicature).
> - (d) Supplying the city’s name would do better on Relevance and Quantity than supplying just the country name.
> - (e) The contextual assumption is that B will supply such information.
> - (f) This contradicts the cooperativity assumption (b).
> - (g) We can therefore conclude that the implicature is true.

If the conversational participants are planning a trip but have already sworn off visiting California, then the addressee’s answer might contain exactly the needed information, namely, that they won’t be visiting Sue. In this case, premise (d) does not hold, so the calculation doesn’t go through.

### Manner-based

3. Well, this presentation was ... interesting.
   $\leadsto$ they did not actually find the presentation engaging.
 
> - (a) Assume the speaker is cooperative.
> - (b) There are less obscure words, like *clear*, *organized*, and *engaging*, competing with *interesting*.
> - (c) If the speaker found the presentation clear, organized, or engaging, she would use these words.
> - (d) This contradicts with (a).
> - (e) Conclusion: the presentation was not organized, engaging, or clear. 


> Exercise: Condider the following conversation.
> 
> Joe: Did Sarah sing at the party? 
> Sue: She made a series of tonal sounds with her mouth.
> 
> Can you infer the implicature, 'Sarah’s singing at the party was horrible.'? If so, how does it arise? 
> Please answer this question using Gricean Maxims.


```
Exercise: Condider the following conversation.

Joe: Who is coming to the party? 
Sue: Bill.

Can you infer the implicature, 'Only Bill is coming to the party.'? If so, how does it arise?
