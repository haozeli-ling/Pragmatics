# Pragmatic meaning

Pragmatics explores how we expand the conventional meanings of spoken and written language into their richer, intended interpretations. In this course, we will examine the principles that drive this process of enrichment, paying particular attention to how systematic and universal these principles are.

The term "pragmatics" was introduced by Charles Morris in 1938. As part of semiotics, the broader study of signs, Morris identified three distinct branches: 
- **Syntax**: Examines how words combine to form phrases and sentences.
  > Concerned with well-formedness and structural relationships.
- **Semantics**: Focuses on meaning, such as truth conditions, reference, and logical form.
  > Example <br>
  > "All cats are mammals" is true if every individual cat is a mammal. 
- **Pragmatics**: Explores how context influences meaning, including speaker intentions and assumptions.
  > Example <br>
  > The utterance "Can you open the window?" pragmatically implies a request rather than a question about ability.

## A few examples of pragmatic meaning

### Implicatures

Letter of recommendation for a philosophy job: 

> Dear Sir, <br>
> Mr. X’s command of English is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. <br>
> Yours, <br>
> Prof. Y, etc.”

This letter leads to the inference that Mr. X is a pour philosopher (in Prof. Y’s opinion). However, we seem to have a clear intuition that this inference does not follow directly from the semantic representation.  

### Context dependency 

Suppose that you hear such an utterance: 

> 'Everyone must submit the final paper on May 15.'

Does this mean that every person in the world is obligated to follow this instruction? Clearly not. The domain of the quantifier *everyone* is restricted to a specific group relevant to the context—perhaps a particular class or group of students. Notably, this restriction is not explicitly stated in the sentence itself.

### Expressives 

Consider the following utterances:

> - 'Sue believes that Kresge should be fired, but I think he is a good guy.'
> - 'Sure believes that that **bastard** Kresge should be fired, but #I think he’s a good guy.'

In the first example, the speaker reports Sue's belief while maintaining their own stance that Kresge is a good guy. In contrast, the addition of bastard in the second example creates an infelicity. This is because the expressive *bastard* conveys the speaker's own negative attitude toward Kresge, making it inconsistent with the continuation. This demonstrates that, even when an expressive is embedded within a belief report, it still reflects the speaker's personal attitude. 

### Rhetorical questions



The pragmatic meanings of these examples are inferred through the specific usages of the utterances, not solely from combinding word meanings. However, it does not mean that they are completely irrelevant to the semantic meanings of those utterances or they cannot be studied using the tools of formal semantics. 

Actually, recent research has increasingly questioned the rigid separation between semantics and pragmatics suggested by the traditional trichotomy. The field of formal pragmatics specifically addresses areas where semantics and pragmatics intersect.
- **Kadmon (2002)**: dedicates substantial discussion to presuppositions and focus association; 
- **Potts (2005)**: examines conventional implicatures and argues they represent a unique aspect of semantics.
