# Downward Entailing Contexts

**Entailment**: If a sentence *S* entails a sentence *S'*, sentence *S* cannot be true without *S'* being true as well. 

1. Pat is a black cat.
2. Pat is a cat.
3. Pat is black.

1 entails 2 and 3. By contrast, neither 2 nor 3 entails 1. 

Contradiction Test: If a sentence *S* entails a sentence *S'*, the expression '*S* but not *S'*'is intuitively contradictory.

4. Pat is a cat, but it is not a black cat.
5. #Pat is a black cat, but it is not black.
6. #Pat is a black cat, but it is not a cat.

## Downward-entailing vs. Upward-entailing

A downward-entailing context is one in which replacing a general term with a more specific term maintains the truth of the statement. By contrast, an upward-entailing context is one in which replacing a specific term with a more general term maintains the truth of the statement.

**Upward-entailing**

7. It rained.
8. It rained hard. 

8 entails 7. (from specific to general)

**Downward-entailing**

9. It is not the case that it rained.
10. It is not the case that it rained hard. 

9 entails 10. (from general to specific)

Negation is an item that triggers an downward-entailing context. 

## More items triggering an downward-entailing context

Conditionals: For a conditional, the antecedent creates a downward-entailing context, while the consequent creates an upward-entailing context.

11. If Shou were a Fujianese, Tiktok would pose a significant concern for U.S. cybersecurity.
12. If Shou were a Chinese, Tiktok would pose a significant concern for U.S. cybersecurity.

12 entails 11. 

13. If Shou were a Chinese, Tiktok would pose a significant concern for U.S. cybersecurity.
14. If Shou were a Chinese, Tiktok would pose a concern for U.S. cybersecurity.

13 entails 14. 

*No*-NPs: For a sentence with a *no*-NP, it can be divided into two parts.  

15. No Spaniards invaded North America in the 14th century.
    
    > No (Spaniards) (invaded North America in the 14th century)
