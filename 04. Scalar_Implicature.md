# Scalar implicature 

These are the most extensively studied types of implicatures to date, particularly the class that has garnered the greatest formal and experimental focus.

**Definition** An utterance *U* conveys a scalar implicature if and only if there exist alternative utterances *U*' that are at least as relevant as *U* in the discourse and are communicatively stronger than *U*.

## Phenomena

1. John or Bill showed up.

   > In First Order Logic, <br>
   > The sentence is true if and only if John showed up, Bill showed up, or both showed up. <br>
   > However, listeners prefer to interprete this sentence as: <br>
   > John or Bill showed up, but NOT both.
