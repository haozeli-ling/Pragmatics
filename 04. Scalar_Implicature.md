# Scalar implicature 

These are the most extensively studied types of implicatures to date, particularly the class that has garnered the greatest formal and experimental focus.

**Definition** An utterance *U* conveys a scalar implicature if and only if there exist alternative utterances *U*' that are at least as relevant as *U* in the discourse and are communicatively stronger than *U*.

## Data

1. John or Bill showed up.

   > In First Order Logic (FOL), the sentence is true if and only if John showed up, Bill showed up, or both showed up. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **John or Bill showed up, but NOT both**.

2. Peter did some of the homework.

   > In FOL, the sentence is true if and only if Peter did at least some of the homework. <br>
   > So, it can be true if Peter did all of the homework. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **Peter did some of homework, but NOT all**.

3. Sue bought three houses.

   > In FOL, the sentence is true if and only if Sue bought at least three houses. <br>
   > So, it can be true if Sue bought more than three houses. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **Sue bought three houses, but NOT more than three**.

4. You are allowed to leave.

   > In FOL, this sentence is true in the situation where the addressee must leave.
   > However, we typically interpret it as: **I can leave, but I am NOT requireed to leave**.

5. This movie is good.

   > In FOL, this sentence is true if the movie is the best movie of this year.
   > However, we typically interpret it as: **this movie is good, but NOT the best**.

All examples involve a lexical item that triggers scalar alternatives: 

- coordinations: (or, and)
- quantifiers: (some, many, most, every)
- numerals: (one, two, three, . . .)
- modals: (allowed to, required to)
- adjectives: (good, best)

## Two potential solutions in lexical semantics

What if we assume that the relevant items inherently encode a stronger meaning? In other words, this implies that scalar implicature is embedded within their lexical meaning.

> For example 
>
> John or Bill showed up. 
> - This sentence is true if and only if John showed up or Bill showed up, but not both.
>
> Sue bought three houses.
> - This sentence is true if and only if Sue bought exactly three houses. 

Although this solution is fairly straightforward, it cannot be correct, as these lexical items sometimes exhibit weaker interpretations or adhere to standard FOL meanings in certain contexts.

First of all, scalar implicatures can be canceled. but lexical meanings cannot. 

6. Peter did some of the homework. For all I know he might have done all of it.
   $\not\Rightarrow$ Peter did some of the homework but not all. For all I know he might have done all of it.
