# Scalar implicature 

These are the most extensively studied types of implicatures to date, particularly the class that has garnered the greatest formal and experimental focus.

**Definition** An utterance *U* conveys a scalar implicature if and only if there exist alternative utterances *U*' that are at least as relevant as *U* in the discourse and are communicatively stronger than *U*.
