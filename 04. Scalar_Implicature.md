# Scalar implicature 

These are the most extensively studied types of implicatures to date, particularly the class that has garnered the greatest formal and experimental focus.

**Definition** An utterance *U* conveys a scalar implicature if and only if there exist alternative utterances *U*' that are at least as relevant as *U* in the discourse and are communicatively stronger than *U*.

## Phenomena

1. John or Bill showed up.

   > In First Order Logic (FOL), the sentence is true if and only if John showed up, Bill showed up, or both showed up. <br>
   > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **John or Bill showed up, but NOT both**.

 2. Peter did some of the homework.

    > In First Order Logic (FOL), the sentence is true if and only if Peter did at least some of the homework. <br>
    > So, it can be true if Peter did all of the homework. <br>
    > However, language users tend to interpret this sentence as: **Peter did some of homework, but NOT all**.
