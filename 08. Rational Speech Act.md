# The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of **recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener**. In this framework, the listener interprets the speaker’s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. Using probability inference, the listener evaluates the likely state of the world based on the speaker's utterance, taking into account that the speaker has reasoned about how the listener would interpret that utterance. 

## Intuition

We have a speaker and a listener operating within a shared context or game. The speaker aims to convey a target piece of information, $s$, and their goal is to select an utterance that will guide the listener to correctly identify $s$ as the intended target.

The speaker and listener would both prefer for the listener to correctly identify $s$. This is a version of the cooperativity assumptions from Grice’s work.

These participants can do better at games like this by reasoning about each other rather than just about the truth conditions of their utterances. 

There are (at least) three levels of inference. 

- The **literal meaning** of $u$. 

- The speaker chooses an utterance $u$ by maximalizing the probability that a naive, literal listener, $L_0$, would correctly infer the state of the world $s$ based on the **literal meaning** of $u$
- Given that the speaker chose to produce $u$, the sophisticated, pragmatic listener, $L_1$, reasons about the pragmatic speaker, $S_1$, and infers $s$.

## Scalar Implicature Game 

Scenario: In the morning, Mom prepared four cookies for Sue's snack time. After school, Mom asked Sue how many cookies she had eaten. Sue responded:
1. I ate some of the cookies. <br>
   $\leadsto$ I ate some, but not all, of the cookies. 

> **Basics of the game**
> 
> Situation space: $S =$ { $s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$ }
> - $s_0$: Sue ate zero cookies.
> - $s_1$: Sue ate one cookie.
> - $s_2$: Sue ate two cookies.
> - $s_3$: Sue ate three cookies.
> - $s_4$: Sue ate four cookie.
>
> Utterance space: $U =$ { $u_{\text{none}}, u_{\text{some}}, u_{\text{all}}$ }
> - $u_{\text{none}}$: 'I ate none of the cookies.'
> - $u_{\text{some}}$: 'I ate some of the cookies'
> - $u_{\text{all}}$: 'I ate all of the cookies'
>
> Semantics:
> - the meaning of $u_{\text{none}}$ is { $s_0$ }
> - the meaning of $u_{\text{some}}$ is { $s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$  }
> - the meaning of $u_{\text{all}}$ is { $s_4$ }
>
> Prior belief: $P(s_0) = P(s_1) = P(s_2) = P(s_3) = P(s_4) = 0.2$

### Literal Listener ($L_0$) 

The literal listener is characterized by an interpretation rule: $P_{L_0} (s | u) = \displaystyle \frac{ ⟦u⟧(s) \cdot P(s) }{ \Sigma_{s' \in S} ⟦u⟧(s') \cdot P(s')  }$

- The literal listener assigns a probability to a situation $s$ given an utterance $u$, based only on the **literal meaning** of $u$. 
- Notation: $⟦u⟧(s) = 1$ if $s \in$ the meaning of $u$; otherwise, 0. 

|       | $s_0$ | $s_1$     | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $s_4$ |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------| ------|
|   **'none'**   |   1   |     0      |   0      |   0      |     0    |
|   **'some'**   |   0   |     0.25   |   0.25   |   0.25   |     0.25     |  
|   **'all'**   |  0   |     0     |   0   |  0   |     1     |   

### Pragmatic Speaker ($S_1$)

Reasoning about the literal listener informs the pragmatic speaker rule: $P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

- $\text{Utility}'(u,s) = \ln (P_{L_0}(s|u)) - \text{Cost}'(u)$
  
  - $\ln (P_{L_0}(s|u))$: This is the informativeness of the utterance $u$. It captures how well $u$ allows the listener to identify $s$, based on the literal listener's interpretation.
  - $\text{Cost}'(u)$ captures the effort or "penalty" associated with producing the utterance $u$.
  - $\alpha$ is a temperature parameter, which modulates how deterministic the speaker is.

- The exponential function enables soft-maximization, allowing the RSA speaker to consider multiple utterance options rather than being restricted to the single highest-utility choice.  

|       | **'none'** | **'some'**     | **'all'** | 
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
|    $s_0$  |   1   |     0      |   0      |   
|    $s_1$   |   0   |    1   |   0   |     
|    $s_2$   |  0   |     1     |   0   |  
|    $s_3$   |  0   |     1     |   0   |
|    $s_4$   |  0   |     0.20   |   0.80   |

### Pragmatic Listener ($L_1$)

The pragmatic listener uses Bayes’ rule to infer the most likely situation $s$ by drawing on their generative model of the speaker and their prior beliefs about $s$. 

$P_{L_1} (s | u) = \displaystyle \frac{P_{S_1}(u | s) \cdot P(s)}{\Sigma_{s' \in S}\ P_{S_1} (u | s')}$

Bayes' rule (after [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes)) gives a mathematical rule for inverting conditional probabilities, allowing one to find the probability of a cause given its effect. 

Now, we can access whether and how the scalar implicature emerges in our cookie scenario under the RSA framework. 

|       | $s_0$ | $s_1$     | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $s_4$ |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------| ------|
|   **'none'**   |   0.2   |     0      |   0      |   0      |     0    |
|   **'some'**   |   0   |     0.06   |   0.06   |   0.06   |     0.01     |  
|   **'all'**   |  0   |     0     |   0   |  0   |     0.25     |
