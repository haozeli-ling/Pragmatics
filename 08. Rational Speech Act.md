# 08. The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of **recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener**. In this framework, the listener interprets the speaker’s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. 

Formally speaking, RSA is a probabilistic model of pragmatic reasoning that formalizes how speakers and listeners use language cooperatively and strategically. Building on the insights of Paul Grice, RSA treats communication as a form of rational social inference: 

- Speakers choose utterances to efficiently convey their intended meanings,
- Listeners interpret utterances by reasoning about why a rational speaker would have chosen them.

Technically, the framework implements this idea using [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference), modeling pragmatic meaning as the result of recursive reasoning between an idealized speaker and listener, each optimizing their choices with respect to communicative goals and costs. By embedding pragmatic principles in a formally explicit and computationally tractable system, RSA provides a unified way to capture graded interpretations, context sensitivity, and variability in human judgments, linking classical pragmatic theory with contemporary cognitive and computational approaches.

The theoretical background of RSA is naturally connected to game theory, in particular to models of communication as strategic interaction between rational agents. In this perspective, linguistic communication can be understood as a form of signaling games, where a speaker (the sender) selects an utterance to convey information about an underlying state, and a listener (the receiver) interprets that utterance to infer the state. RSA adopts this game-theoretic intuition but enriches it with Bayesian inference, allowing agents to reason probabilistically about one another’s beliefs, goals, and choices.

## Intuition

We have a speaker and a listener operating within a shared context or game. The speaker aims to convey a target piece of information, $s$, and their goal is to select an utterance that will guide the listener to correctly identify $s$ as the intended target.

The speaker and listener would both prefer for the listener to correctly identify $s$. This is a version of the cooperativity assumptions from Grice’s work.

These participants can do better at games like this by reasoning about each other rather than just about the truth conditions of their utterances. 

There are (at least) three levels of inference. 

- The **literal meaning** of $u$. 

- The speaker chooses an utterance $u$ by maximalizing the probability that a naive, literal listener, $L_0$, would correctly infer the state of the world $s$ based on the **literal meaning** of $u$
- Given that the speaker chose to produce $u$, the sophisticated, pragmatic listener, $L_1$, reasons about the pragmatic speaker, $S_1$, and infers $s$.

## Scalar Implicature Game 

Scenario: In the morning, Mom prepared four cookies for Sue's snack time. After school, Mom asked Sue how many cookies she had eaten. Sue responded:
1. I ate some of the cookies. <br>
   $\leadsto$ I ate some, but not all, of the cookies. 

> **Basics of the game**

> Situation space: $S =$ { $s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4$ }
> - $s_0$: Sue ate zero cookies.
> - $s_1$: Sue ate one cookie.
> - $s_2$: Sue ate two cookies.
> - $s_3$: Sue ate three cookies.
> - $s_4$: Sue ate four cookie.

> Utterance space: $U =$ { $u_{\text{none}}, u_{\text{some}}, u_{\text{all}}$ }

### Literal Listener ($L_0$) 

The literal listener is characterized by an interpretation rule: $P_{L_0} (s | u) = \displaystyle \frac{ ⟦u⟧(s) \cdot P(s) }{ \Sigma_{s' \in S} ⟦u⟧(s') \cdot P(s')  }$

- The literal listener assigns a probability to a situation $s$ given an utterance $u$, based only on the **literal meaning** of $u$. 
- Notation: $⟦u⟧(s) = 1$ if $s \in$ the meaning of $u$; otherwise, 0. 

|       | $s_0$ | $s_1$     | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $s_4$ |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------| ------|
|   **'none'**   |   1   |     0      |   0      |   0      |     0    |
|   **'some'**   |   0   |     0.25   |   0.25   |   0.25   |     0.25     |  
|   **'all'**   |  0   |     0     |   0   |  0   |     1     |   

### Pragmatic Speaker ($S_1$)

Reasoning about the literal listener informs the pragmatic speaker rule: $P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{{\ }\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

- $\text{Utility}'(u,s) = \ln (P_{L_0}(s|u)) - \text{Cost}'(u)$
  
  - $\ln (P_{L_0}(s|u))$: This is the informativeness of the utterance $u$. It captures how well $u$ allows the listener to identify $s$, based on the literal listener's interpretation.
  - $\text{Cost}'(u)$ captures the effort or "penalty" associated with producing the utterance $u$.
  - $\alpha$ is a temperature parameter, which modulates how deterministic the speaker is.

- The exponential function enables soft-maximization, allowing the RSA speaker to consider multiple utterance options rather than being restricted to the single highest-utility choice.
- For simplicity, let's assume that producing any utterance incurs no significant cost ($\text{Cost}'(u) = 0$) and that $\alpha = 1$. 

|       | **'none'** | **'some'**     | **'all'** | 
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
|    $s_0$  |   1   |     0      |   0      |   
|    $s_1$   |   0   |    1   |   0   |     
|    $s_2$   |  0   |     1     |   0   |  
|    $s_3$   |  0   |     1     |   0   |
|    $s_4$   |  0   |     0.20   |   0.80   |

### Pragmatic Listener ($L_1$)

The pragmatic listener uses Bayes’ rule to infer the most likely situation $s$ by drawing on their generative model of the speaker and their prior beliefs about $s$. The pragmatic listener goes beyond the literal meaning of an utterance and infers the most likely intended meaning by considering the reasoning of a pragmatic speaker ($P_{S_1}$). This inference is modeled probabilistically, taking into account both the prior probability of different meanings and **the likelihood that a rational speaker would choose a given utterance** to convey that meaning.

$P_{L_1} (s | u) = \displaystyle \frac{P_{S_1}(u | s) \cdot P(s)}{\Sigma_{s' \in S}\ P_{S_1} (u | s') \cdot P(s)}$

Bayes' rule (after [Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes)) gives a mathematical rule for inverting conditional probabilities, allowing one to find the probability of a cause given its effect. 

Now, we can access whether and how the scalar implicature emerges in our cookie scenario under the RSA framework. 

|       | $s_0$ | $s_1$     | $s_2$ | $s_3$ | $s_4$ |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|-------| ------|
|   **'none'**   |   1   |     0      |   0      |   0      |     0    |
|   **'some'**   |   0   |     0.31   |   0.31   |   0.31   |     0.06     |  
|   **'all'**   |  0   |     0     |   0   |  0   |     1     |
