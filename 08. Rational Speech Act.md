# The Rational Speech Act Framework (RSA)

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework conceptualizes communication as a process of **recursive reasoning between a speaker and a listener**. In this framework, the listener interprets the speaker’s utterance by considering the perspective of a cooperative speaker attempting to inform a naive listener about some state of affairs. Using probability inference, the listener evaluates the likely state of the world based on the speaker's utterance, taking into account that the speaker has reasoned about how the listener would interpret that utterance. 

## Intuition

We have a speaker and a listener operating within a shared context or game. The speaker aims to convey a target piece of information, $s$, and their goal is to select an utterance that will guide the listener to correctly identify $s$ as the intended target.

The speaker and listener would both prefer for the listener to correctly identify $s$. This is a version of the cooperativity assumptions from Grice’s work.

These participants can do better at games like this by reasoning about each other rather than just about the truth conditions of their utterances. 

There are (at least) three levels of inference. 

- The speaker chooses an utterance $u$ by maximalizing the probability that a naive, literal listener, $L_0$, would correctly infer the state of the world $s$ based on the **literal meaning** of $u$
- Given that the speaker chose to produce $u$, the sophisticated, pragmatic listener, $L_1$, reasons about the pragmatic speaker, $S_1$, and infers $s$.
