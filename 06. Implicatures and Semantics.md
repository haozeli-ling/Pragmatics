# 06. Understanding Conversational Implicature helps semantics

Intuitively, natural language or is frequently interpreted in an "exclusive" sense, meaning "one or the other, but not both." We can easily write a truth-table for exclusive *or*, which we will represent with the symbol $\underline{\vee}$.

| **p** | **q** | **p ∨ q** | **p $\underline{\vee}$ q** | 
|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
|   T   |   T   |     T     |   F   |   
|   T   |   F   |     T     |   T   |   
|   F   |   T   |     T     |   T   |   
|   F   |   F   |     F     |   F   |   

Issues: 
- Is English "or" truly semantically ambiguous between two distinct truth-conditional connectives?
- Can it be consistently analyzed as inclusive disjunction, with the apparent exceptions explained through pragmatic factors?

Let's try the conversational implicature approach: 

1. Sue has a dog or a cat. <br>
   $\leadsto$ Sue has a dog or a cat, but not both. (Exclusive "or")

Pragmatic derivation

- (a) Assume that the speaker is cooperative.
- (b) Given Maxim of Quantity, if the speaker had evidence that Mary has a dog $\color{blue}{\text{and}}$ a cat, she could have made a more informative statement: *Sue has a dog AND a cat*.
- (c) This contradicts the speaker's performance.
- (d) It implies that the speaker believes that Sue does not have both.

An argument from negation: 

2. Sue does not have a dog or a cat.

If "or" were truly ambiguous between inclusive and exclusive meanings, its negation would also be expected to exhibit ambiguity. For instance, Sentence 2 should have an interpretation asserting that Mary has either neither or both. However, Sentence 2 unambiguously conveys the negation of the inclusive "or", asserting instead that Mary has neither.

## Diagnosing conversational implicatures

In semantics and pragmatics, it is often necessary to determine whether a given meaning constitutes a semantic entailment or merely a conversational implicature. The following methods are particularly helpful for this purpose:

**Cancellability**: Conversational implicatures can be canceled. By contrast, ordinary entailments cannot be cancelled. 

3. Alex solved some of the exercises. In fact, she solved all of them.
4. #Alice has a cute dog, but in fact she doesn’t have a dog.

**Reinforceability**: Conversational implicatures can be reinforced without sounding redundant. By contrast, reinforcing ordinary entailments produces redundant statements:

5. Alex solved some of the exercises, but not all of them.
6. #Alice has a cute dog, and she has a dog.

**Context dependence**: An utterance made in a certain context may give rise to a conversational implicature, but there are other contexts in which the same utterance doesn’t give rise to this conversational implicature (See 03). Ordinary entailments do not depend on the context in which sentences are uttered. No matter in which context *Alice has a cute dog* is uttered, it will always give rise to the inference that Alice has a dog.
