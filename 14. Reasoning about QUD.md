# Reasoning about QUD

In our real life, we often speak some obvious false utterance to create some specific pragmatic effects. 

> **Hyperbole** <br>
> 
> Alex:  Hey! How was that new Italian place you went to last night? <br>
> Jamie:  Ugh, **it took a million years to get a table.** <br>
> Alex: Seriously? Did you have a reservation? <br>
> Jamie: Yeah, but we were still waiting for like 45 minutes. What’s the point of a reservation if they ignore it? <br>
> Alex: Wow, that’s rough. Was the food at least worth it? <br>
> Jamie: I mean… it was good. But I don’t know if *"good pasta"* is worth *"I’m starving and watching other people eat for an hour."* <br>
> Alex: Sounds like the hype isn't totally justified. <br> 
> Jamie: Exactly. Next time I’m bringing snacks for the wait. 

In this example, Jamie's utterance was blatantly false, violating the Maxim of Quality. Yet, communication didn’t break down. Instead, Alex correctly inferred that the wait wasn’t literally a million years, but that Jamie felt it had been far too long.

One of the most intriguing aspects of communication is that speakers often don’t mean exactly what they say. A key part of the listener’s task is to grasp the intended meaning even when the literal content is false. This ability to understand nonliteral language presents a compelling challenge for theories of language comprehension.

> **Irony**

> Nina: So… two hours behind schedule. Impressive. <br>
> Sam:   Yeah, I love showing up on time just to sit on the floor of a crowded hallway. <br>
> Leo:  **That was quick**, huh? <br>
> Nina: (laughs) Right? Just a breezy two-hour delay. Blink and you’ll miss it. <br>
> Sam: Honestly, I could’ve watched a whole movie in the time we waited. <br>
> Leo: At this point, “starts at 6” must be code for “see you at 8, maybe.” <br>
> Nina:  They really need to get their act together. It’s not their first event! <br>
> I’m bringing snacks and a folding chair next time.
