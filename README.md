# Pragmatic Theory

Welcome to this advanced course on pragmatics, which is an extension of the course *Semantics & Pragmatics*. Building on foundational concepts, this course delves deeper into the dynamic interplay between meaning and context in language use.

The course is structured around two central components: implicatures and discourse phenomena. We will scrutinize how speakers communicate meanings beyond the literal content of their words and explore how larger units of discourse contribute to anaphora and coherence. Through these topics, we will uncover the subtle yet systematic principles that govern pragmatic meaning.

To aid our exploration, we will introduce formal tools that provide rigorous frameworks for analyzing these phenomena. These tools will enable us to model complex pragmatic behaviors, offering a more precise understanding of how meaning is constructed and conveyed in real-world contexts.

By the end of this course, you will have developed a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of language use and acquired advanced analytical skills that will enrich your broader studies in linguistics.
