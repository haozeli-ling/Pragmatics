# Gricean maxims

Conversational partners typically acknowledge a shared purpose in their dialogue. At any given moment, certain "conversational moves" are deemed appropriate or inappropriate for achieving their mutual objectives.

## Cooperative Principle
People should contribute to a conversation in a way that's appropriate for the purpose of the exchange. It's based on the idea that speakers and listeners follow conversational maxims to make interactions meaningful and constructive.

- **Maxims of Quantity**: (a) Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the
exchange). (b) Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.
- **Maxims of Quality**: Try to make your contribution one that is true. (a) Do not say what you believe to be false. (b) Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
- **Maxim of Relation**: Be relevant.
- **Maxims of Manner**: Be perspicuous: (a) Avoid obscurity of expression. (b) Avoid ambiguity. (c) Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). (d) Be orderly.

In addition to conversational maxims, there are other principles—such as aesthetic, social, or moral guidelines—that may influence conversational exchanges, including maxims like "Be polite."

## Generating Conversational Implicature

Grice's maxims provide an initial framework for *formalizing* the reasoning by which a hearer may infer that a speaker is conveying more than what is explicitly stated---an idea central to **conversational implicature**, which refers to information implied in a conversation but not directly expressed.
