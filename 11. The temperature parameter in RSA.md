# The temperature parameter in RSA 

The **temperature parameter** (often denoted as $\alpha$) in the RSA framework plays a crucial role in shaping how speakers and listeners make decisions about language use. It essentially controls how **rational** or **deterministic** an agent behaves when selecting an utterance or interpreting meaning.

In the RSA framework, the pragmatic speakerâ€™s choice of an utterance is determined by a **soft-max function**:

$P_{S_1} (u | s) = \displaystyle \frac{e^{\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u,s)}}{\Sigma_{u' \in U}\ e^{\alpha \cdot \text{Utility}'(u',s)}}$

The temperature parameter $\alpha$ modulates how strongly the utility affects the probability of selecting an utterance.

### Effects of the temperature parameter

**High $\alpha$ (High Rationality)**

- **Behavior**: The speaker is nearly deterministic, choosing the utterance with the highest utility almost every time.
- **Effect**: Small differences in utility lead to **large differences in probabilities**.
- **Intuition**: The speaker behaves very rationally, prioritizing informativeness and cost-effectiveness strictly.

  > **Example** If $\alpha = 10$, the exponential scaling amplifies utility differences significantly. <br>
  > $e^{10 \cdot \text{Utility}'(u, s)}$ <br>
  > This means even slight advantages in utility will make one utterance much more likely than another.

**Low $\alpha$ (Low Rationality or Noisier Behavior)**

- **Behavior**: The speaker is more probabilistic, often choosing utterances with lower utility.
- **Effect**: Differences in utility have **minimal impact** on choice probability.
- **Intuition**: The speaker is less focused, possibly due to cognitive limitations, uncertainty, or external noise.

  > **Example**: If $\alpha = 0.1$, the scaling is much gentler: <br>
  > $e^{0.1 \cdot \text{Utility}(u, s)}$ <br>
  > Here, utility differences are dampened, making all utterances more equally likely.

**$\alpha = 0$ (Uniform Random Behavior)**

- **Behavior**: The speaker chooses utterances **randomly**, ignoring utility entirely.
- **Effect**: All utterances have equal probability regardless of their utility.
- **Intuition**: There is no preference or rationality in choosing utterances, akin to complete indecision or randomness.

### Exponential growth magnifies differences

Exponential functions grow much faster than linear or even quadratic functions. 

> **Example**
> - $e^{0.1} \approx 1.105$
> - $e^{0.2} \approx 1.221$
> - $e^{0.5} \approx 1.649$
> - $e^1 \approx 2.718$

Even a small difference in utility (e.g., 0.1 vs. 0.2) results in significantly different exponentials.

Suppose we have two utterances $u_1$ and $u_2$ with small utility differences:

- $\text{Utility}'(u_1, s) = 1.0$
- $\text{Utility}'(u_2, s) = 0.9$

If $\alpha = 1$, the exponential functions are: $e^{1} \approx 2.718$ and $e^{1} \approx 2.460$

- $P(u_1 \mid s) = \displaystyle \frac{2.718}{2.718 + 2.460} \approx 0.525$
- $P(u_2 \mid s) = \displaystyle \frac{2.460}{2.718 + 2.460} \approx 0.475$

If $\alpha = 5$, the exponential functions are: $e^{5 \times 1.0} \approx 148.4$ and $e^{5 \times 0.9} \approx 90.0$

- $P(u_1 \mid s) = \displaystyle \frac{148.4}{148.4 + 90.0} \approx 0.623$
- $P(u_2 \mid s) = \displaystyle \frac{90.0}{148.4 + 90.0} \approx 0.377$

### **Practical Examples in Communication**

**High $\alpha$ Scenario (Strict Teacher)**

   - A teacher choosing examples to explain a concept may consistently pick the most illustrative example (highest utility), minimizing ambiguity.
   - High $\alpha$ ensures that students get the clearest, most informative explanation every time.

**Low $\alpha$ Scenario (Casual Conversation)**

   - In everyday conversation, speakers might use less optimal language due to social comfort, laziness, or context.
   - Low $\alpha$ allows for more variation and even less-informative utterances, reflecting natural, imperfect communication.

**Moderate $\alpha$ (Balanced Communication)**

   - A lecturer may choose examples that are informative but also engage students, balancing utility with social interaction.
   - Moderate $\alpha$ supports a mix of clear communication and contextual flexibility.

### **Implications in Cognitive Modeling**

- **Human-Like Behavior**: People are not perfectly rational. By adjusting $\alpha$, RSA can model realistic, human-like language use that reflects occasional errors, heuristics, or biases.
- **Learning and Adaptation**: In language acquisition, children may have a low $\alpha$ (exploring many language forms) that increases as they learn the most effective communication methods.
- **Cultural and Contextual Variations**: Different cultures or contexts might require different levels of rationality in communication, which RSA can simulate by varying $\alpha$.
